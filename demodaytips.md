## Before Demo Day
Once you have reached MVP and are approved - **MAKE AN MVP BRANCH, PUSH IT TO GITHUB, AND DON’T MESS WITH IT!!**


**Clean up the Browser:**
- Clear your browser's autocomplete history to avoid any potential embarrassment

- If displaying in mobile view, detach the dev tools from the browser and hide the window

**Presentation - Slides Order:**

**Presentation - Tips:**
- Use PRESENTATION MODE - and practice beforehand
- Practice presenting/demoing your app OUT LOUD
- Slow down if presenting lots of videos/images/animated transitions - there may be a bit of a lag
- Time yourself - stay within the 5-minute window

**DATA**
- Make sure you have good, relevant data in your database to showcase real-world use cases for your app
- Avoid typing in something like "test1" or "asdfdsa"... or even worse, "poop"... just to demonstrate that an input field works.

## BEFORE YOU JUMP INTO SERVER SIDE, UPDATE YOUR README!!
- Synopsis of the problem you're solving with this app
- Include instructions on how download/clone/install and run the app - npm start, json server port, etc.
- ☝️  This reminds YOU in 3 months how to run your app, because you will have forgotten. Trust me.
- Link to or insert an image (or both) of your ERD
- Link to or insert an image (or both) of your Wireframe
